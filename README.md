# ðŸŒ³ Go Bonzaiâ„¢ File Completer

Provides the regular shell completion most expect for files and
directories with the trailing slash added to directories for quick
visualization. Nothing special beyond that (colors, emojis, etc.)

## Style Guidelines

* Everything through `go fmt` or equiv, no exceptions
* In Vim `set textwidth=72` (not 80 to line numbers fit)
* Use `/* */` for package documentation comment, `//` elsewhere
* Smallest possible names for given scope while still clear
* Favor additional packages (possibly in `internal`) over long names
* Package globals that will be used a lot can be single capital
* Must be good reason to use more than 4 character pkg name
* Avoid unnecessary comments
* Use "deciduous tree" emoji ðŸŒ³ to mark Bonzai stuff
