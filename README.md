# ðŸŒ³ Go Bonzaiâ„¢ File Completer

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/rwxrob/compfile?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/rwxrob/compfile)

Provides the regular shell completion most expect for files and
directories with the trailing slash added to directories for quick
visualization. Nothing special beyond that (colors, emojis, etc.)

## Style Guidelines

* Everything through `go fmt` or equiv, no exceptions
* In Vim `set textwidth=72` (not 80 to line numbers fit)
* Use `/* */` for package documentation comment, `//` elsewhere
* Smallest possible names for given scope while still clear
* Favor additional packages (possibly in `internal`) over long names
* Package globals that will be used a lot can be single capital
* Must be good reason to use more than 4 character pkg name
* Avoid unnecessary comments
* Use "deciduous tree" emoji ðŸŒ³ to mark Bonzai stuff

## Changelog

* Expand `~` to user's home directory
* Complete relative paths ./ and ../

```bash
z rm ../
../cowsay/     ../.git/       ../go.mod      ../isosec/     ../main.go
../README.md ../getrc/      ../.gitignore  ../go.sum      ../LICENSE
../nullptr/    ../sl/
```

* Re-implement `entriesWithSlash` and `isDir` functions, previously
  re-used from [rwxrob/fs](https://github.com/rwxrob/fs) library. This
  library logs out errors to stderr (instead of returning them) and thus
  ruins the UX.

```bash
z rm ~/Druntime error: index out of range [0] with length 0
```

* Support for completing multiple arguments. The last argument is the
  one which gets completed, instead of limiting it to `args[0]`.

```bash
z rm cowsay/cowsay.go isosec/
isosec/isosec.go  isosec/parse.go
```
